#+TITLE: SSH in emacs with =begin_src=
#+HTML_HEAD: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://gongzhitaao.org/orgcss/org.css"/>

* Connecting to SSH
Base thing is to try any command to server/VM. I set up EC2 instance on AWS cloud.
You have to make sure that your =begin_src= block has the information about where to run those commands. To do that use:  =#+begin_src shell :dir /ssh:ubuntu@18.153.79.168:/home/ubuntu#+end_src=. (temporary IP address, go head, try to brute-force that ssh, I dare you :)).
If you have private/public keys pair configured, it should run without any problems. When password is required, you will get prompt in emacs. Emacs also ask you if you want to store that password so you won't need to write it again. But REMBMBER. If you agree to that, the password will be stored in plaintext in your =~/= directory (you will see path to the file).

#+begin_src 
begin_src shell :dir /ssh:ubuntu@18.153.79.168:/home/ubuntu
end_src
#+end_src

** Checking files on home directory
#+begin_src shell :dir /ssh:ubuntu@18.153.79.168:/home/ubuntu
  ls -al
#+end_src

** Testing more complicated operations via src-begin-via-ssh

#+begin_src shell :dir /ssh:ubuntu@18.153.79.168:/home/ubuntu
  mkdir -p testing_directory
  cd testing_directory
  touch test_file.sh
  echo "echo Hello po raz drugi" > test_file.sh
  chmod +x test_file.sh
  ./test_file.sh
  rm test_file.sh
  cd ..
  rm -rf testing_directory
  ls -al
#+end_src
